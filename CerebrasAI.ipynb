            "**Network Reconnaissance Detection Analysis**\n",
            "\n",
            "Based on the provided structured network data, I have analyzed the logs for potential port scanning activities. While the logs do not explicitly mention port numbers, I have made inferences based on the protocol information (mostly TCP, protocol 6) and other patterns.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Identified Scanning Patterns:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Sequential Port Access Pattern:** Although the logs do not explicitly mention port numbers, the high frequency of connections from a single source IP address (172.16.0.1) to a single destination IP address (192.168.10.50) within a short time frame (3:30) suggests a possible sequential port scanning pattern.\n",
            "2. **Multiple Ports Accessed from Single Sources:** The logs show multiple connections from various source IP addresses (e.g., 104.16.28.216, 104.97.125.160, 151.101.130.2) to different destination IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.10.5, 192.168.10.9, 192.168.10.25). This could indicate a scanning pattern where an attacker is trying to identify open ports on multiple targets.\n",
            "3. **Unusual Port Access Frequencies:** The high frequency of connections from 172.16.0.1 to 192.168.10.50 (43 entries) within a short time frame (3:30) is unusual and may indicate a scanning pattern.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Source IP Addresses Involved:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **172.16.0.1:** This IP address is the most active source IP address, with 43 entries in the logs. It is likely involved in a scanning pattern, targeting 192.168.10.50.\n",
            "2. **104.16.28.216:** This IP address has 2 entries in the logs, targeting 192.168.10.5. It may be involved in a scanning pattern, but the frequency is lower than 172.16.0.1.\n",
            "3. **104.97.125.160:** This IP address has 3 entries in the logs, targeting 192.168.10.9. It may be involved in a scanning pattern, but the frequency is lower than 172.16.0.1.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Targeted Port Ranges:**\n",
            "\n",
            "Although the logs do not explicitly mention port numbers, based on the protocol information (mostly TCP, protocol 6), it is likely that the targeted port ranges include:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Port 80 (HTTP):** This is the most common port used for HTTP traffic and is likely targeted by the scanning patterns.\n",

            "\n",
            "Based on the identified scanning patterns, it is likely that the attackers are using the following scanning techniques:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **TCP SYN Scanning:** This technique involves sending a SYN packet to a target port and analyzing the response to determine if the port is open.\n",
            "2. **TCP Connect Scanning:** This technique involves establishing a full TCP connection to a target port and analyzing the response to determine if the port is open.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Recommendations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Implement Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDPS):** IDPS can help detect and prevent scanning patterns by analyzing network traffic and identifying suspicious activity.\n",
            "2. **Configure Firewall Rules:** Firewall rules can be configured to block traffic from known scanning IP addresses and restrict access to sensitive ports.\n",
            "3. **Monitor Network Traffic:** Regularly monitoring network traffic can help identify scanning patterns and prevent potential attacks.\n",
            "\n",
